# GDPR Compliance Implementation

This document outlines the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance features implemented in the Hambax application.

## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union. We have implemented several features to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Cookie Consent Mechanism

A cookie consent banner has been implemented to inform users about the use of cookies and to obtain their consent. The banner appears when a user first visits the site and allows them to:

- Accept all cookies
- Decline all cookies
- Customize their cookie preferences

The cookie consent preferences are stored in the browser's localStorage and are respected throughout the application. Google Analytics is disabled if the user does not consent to analytics cookies.

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/CookieConsent.js` - The cookie consent banner component
- `src/App.js` - Integration of the cookie consent banner

### 2. Privacy Policy

A comprehensive privacy policy has been created to inform users about how their data is collected, processed, and stored. The privacy policy includes information about:

- Types of data collected
- How data is used
- Legal basis for processing
- Data sharing and disclosure
- Data retention
- User data protection rights
- Data security
- International data transfers
- Children's privacy
- Changes to the privacy policy
- Contact information

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/pages/PrivacyPolicyPage.js` - The privacy policy page component
- `src/routes.js` - Route configuration for the privacy policy page

### 3. Data Access Request Form

A data access request form has been implemented to allow users to exercise their GDPR rights, including:

- Right to access their data
- Right to rectification (correction of inaccurate data)
- Right to erasure (deletion of data)
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to object to processing
- Right to data portability

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/pages/DataAccessRequestPage.js` - The data access request form component
- `src/routes.js` - Route configuration for the data access request page

### 4. Footer with Privacy Links

A footer has been added to the application with links to the privacy policy and data access request pages, making these pages easily accessible from any page in the application.

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/Footer.js` - The footer component
- `src/App.js` - Integration of the footer component

### 5. Multilingual Support

All GDPR-related components have been translated into the three languages supported by the application:

- English
- German
- Russian

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/locales/en/translation.json` - English translations
- `src/locales/de/translation.json` - German translations
- `src/locales/ru/translation.json` - Russian translations

## Usage

### Cookie Consent

The cookie consent banner appears automatically when a user first visits the site. Users can:

1. Click "Accept All" to accept all cookies
2. Click "Decline All" to decline all non-essential cookies
3. Click "Customize" to select which types of cookies they want to accept

### Privacy Policy

The privacy policy page is accessible via:

1. The footer link "Privacy Policy"
2. The direct URL `/privacy-policy`
3. The "More Information" link in the cookie consent banner

### Data Access Request

The data access request form is accessible via:

1. The footer link "Data Access Request"

3. The link in the privacy policy under "Your Data Protection Rights"

## Testing

   - Verify that all sections are displayed correctly
   - Check that links to the data access request page work

   - Submit the form and verify that the success message appears

4. **Footer:**

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to enhance GDPR compliance:

1. Implement a backend API to process data access requests
